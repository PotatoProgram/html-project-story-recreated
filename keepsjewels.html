        <h1>Keeps Jewels</h1>
        <p>You decide to keep the jewels. You fly off
            to Egypt with the jewels in your beak. The
            moment you get there, however, there's no 
            turning back. It's too cold in Europe, and
            the poor people are probably all dead by
            now.</p>
