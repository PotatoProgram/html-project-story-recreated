    <h1>The Happy Prince</h1>
    <p>High above the city, on a tall column,
         stood the statue of the Happy Prince. 
         He was gilded all over with thin leaves
         of fine gold, for eyes he had two
         bright sapphires, and a large red
         ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.</p>
    <p>He was very much admired indeed.</p>
    <p>“He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”
         remarked one of the Town Councillors
         who wished to gain a reputation for
         having artistic tastes; “only not quite
         so useful,” he added, fearing lest
         people should think him unpractical,
         which he really was not.</p>
    <p>“Why can’t you be like the 
        Happy Prince?” asked a
         sensible mother of her little boy
         who was crying for the moon.
         “The Happy Prince never dreams
         of crying for anything.”</p>
    <p>“I am glad there is some one
         in the world who is quite happy,”
         muttered a disappointed man as he
         gazed at the wonderful statue.</p>
    <p>“He looks just like an angel,” 
        said the Charity Children as 
        they came out of the cathedral in 
        their bright scarlet cloaks and their
         clean white pinafores.</p>
    <p>“How do you know?” said the
         Mathematical Master, “you have never
         seen one.”</p>
    <p>“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” 
        answered the children; and the 
        Mathematical Master frowned and 
        looked very severe, for he did not 
        approve of children dreaming.</p>
    <p>One night there flew over the city a 
        little Swallow. His friends had gone 
        away to Egypt six weeks before, but 
        he had stayed behind, for he was in 
        love with the most beautiful Reed. 
        He had met her early in the spring 
        as he was flying down the river 
        after a big yellow moth, and had 
        been so attracted by her slender 
        waist that he had stopped to talk 
        to her.</p>
    <p>“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, 
        who liked to come to the point at 
        once, and the Reed made him a low 
        bow. So he flew round and round her, 
        touching the water with his wings, 
        and making silver ripples. This was 
        his courtship, and it lasted all 
        through the summer.</p>
    <p>“It is a ridiculous attachment,” 
        twittered the other Swallows; “she 
        has no money, and far too many 
        relations”; and indeed the river 
        was quite full of Reeds. Then, 
        when the autumn came they all 
        flew away.</p>
    <p>After they had gone he felt lonely, 
        and began to tire of his lady-love. 
        “She has no conversation,” he said, 
        “and I am afraid that she is a 
        coquette, for she is always flirting 
        with the wind.” And certainly, 
        whenever the wind blew, the Reed 
        made the most graceful curtseys. 
        “I admit that she is domestic,” 
        he continued, “but I love 
        travelling, and my wife, 
        consequently, should love 
        travelling also.”</p>
    <p>“Will you come away with me?” he 
        said finally to her; but the Reed 
        shook her head, she was so attached 
        to her home.</p>
    <p>“You have been trifling with me,” 
        he cried. “I am off to the Pyramids. 
        Good-bye!” and he flew away.</p>
    <p>All day long he flew, and at 
        night-time he arrived at the city. 
        “Where shall I put up?” he said; 
        “I hope the town has made 
        preparations.”</p>
    <p>Then he saw the statue on the 
        tall column.</p>
    <p>“I will put up there,” he cried; 
        “it is a fine position, with plenty 
        of fresh air.” So he alighted just 
        between the feet of the 
        Happy Prince.</p>
    <p>“I have a golden bedroom,” he said 
        softly to himself as he looked 
        round, and he prepared to go to 
        sleep; but just as he was putting 
        his head under his wing a large 
        drop of water fell on him.</p>
    <p>“What a curious thing!” he cried; 
        “there is not a single cloud in the 
        sky, the stars are quite clear and 
        bright, and yet it is raining. The 
        climate in the north of Europe is 
        really dreadful. The Reed used to
        like the rain, but that was merely 
        her selfishness.”</p>
    <p>Then another drop fell.</p>
    <p>“What is the use of a statue if it 
        cannot keep the rain off?” he said; 
        “I must look for a good 
        chimney-pot,” and he determined to 
        fly away.</p>
    <p>But before he had opened his wings, 
        a third drop fell, and he looked 
        up, and saw—Ah! what did he see?</p>
    <p>The eyes of the Happy Prince were 
        filled with tears, and tears were 
        running down his golden cheeks. 
        His face was so beautiful in the 
        moonlight that the little Swallow 
        was filled with pity.</p>
    <p>“Who are you?” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am the Happy Prince.”</p>
    <p>“Why are you weeping then?”
         asked the Swallow; “you have quite 
         drenched me.”</p>
    <p>“When I was alive and had a human 
        heart,” answered the statue, “I did 
        not know what tears were, for I 
        lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, 
        where sorrow is not allowed to 
        enter. In the daytime I played with 
        my companions in the garden, and 
        in the evening I led the dance in 
        the Great Hall. Round the garden 
        ran a very lofty wall, but I never 
        cared to ask what lay beyond it, 
        everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.”</p></p>
